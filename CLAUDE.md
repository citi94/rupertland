# Rupertland Government Website Development Guide

## Project Overview
This is a fictional UK Government-style website for the "Principality of Rupertland" that follows exact GOV.UK design patterns and contains comprehensive government services.

**Architecture:** Single-Page Application (SPA) using JavaScript navigation for maximum efficiency and maintainability.

## Current Architecture - Single-Page Application (SPA)

### Overview
The site has been completely refactored from 50+ static HTML files to a single-page application (`index-spa.html`) for improved efficiency and maintainability. This approach eliminates code duplication and provides instant navigation.

### Key Files
- **`index-spa.html`** - Main SPA file containing all pages as sections
- **`netlify.toml`** - Configuration with catch-all redirect to SPA
- **`styles.css`** - External CSS file for GOV.UK styling
- **No legacy files** - All content migrated to SPA architecture

### Complete SPA Structure
```
index-spa.html
â”œâ”€â”€ Single <head> with CSS and metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ Shared <header> with navigation
â”œâ”€â”€ Page sections with id="page-name" class="page"
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Home page (active by default)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ About Rupertland (government overview)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Government Services (service directory)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Digital ID & Citizen Portal (authentication hub)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Identity Card Application (form workflow)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Tax Calculator (interactive calculator)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ News & Announcements (government updates)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Contact Government (contact directory)

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Government Departments (ministries, agencies, structure)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Constitution (fundamental law, rights, amendments)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Data Protection (privacy rights, data laws)
â”œâ”€â”€ Shared <footer>
â””â”€â”€ JavaScript navigation system
```

### Navigation System
- **showPage(pageId)** - Core navigation function
- **Browser history support** - Back/forward buttons work correctly
- **URL hash routing** - Direct links to pages work (e.g., #digital-id)
- **Dynamic page titles** - Page title updates based on current page
- **Scroll to top** - Automatic scroll on page change

### Form Handling
All forms include client-side JavaScript handlers:
- **Tax Calculator** - Real-time tax calculation with breakdown
- **ID Application** - Application submission with reference numbers
- **Contact Form** - Message submission with confirmation
- **Form Styling** - Matches ofcat standards with proper form classes

### CSS Architecture
```css
/* Page visibility control */
.page { display: none; }
.page.active { display: block; }

/* Navigation styling */
.nav-link { cursor: pointer; }
.govuk-breadcrumbs__link--js { cursor: pointer; }

/* Form components (matching ofcat) */
.form-group, .form-label, .form-input, .form-hint
.radio-group, .radio-item
.success-panel, .error-panel
.button, .button:hover
```

## Development Process - SPA Maintenance

### 1. Adding New Pages (Recursive System Approach)
```bash
# Step 1: Identify missing pages using recursive analysis
grep -o "showPage('[^']*')" index-spa.html | sort | uniq > referenced_pages.txt
grep -o 'id="[^"]*" class="page"' index-spa.html | grep -o 'id="[^"]*"' | sed 's/id="//;s/"//' > existing_pages.txt
diff referenced_pages.txt existing_pages.txt  # Shows missing pages

# Step 2: Prioritize by reference frequency
grep -o "showPage('[^']*')" index-spa.html | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr  # Most referenced first
```

```javascript
// Step 3: Add new page section in HTML
<div id="new-page" class="page">
    <div class="govuk-breadcrumbs"><!-- Breadcrumbs --></div>
    <main class="govuk-main-wrapper">
        <!-- Page content with proper GOV.UK styling -->
    </main>
</div>

// Step 4: Update page titles in JavaScript
const titles = {
    'new-page': 'New Page Title - GOV.RP',
    // ... existing titles
};

// Step 5: Add navigation links throughout SPA
<a onclick="showPage('new-page')" class="govuk-link nav-link">New Page</a>
```

### 2. Content Migration Process
```bash
# Extract content from legacy HTML files
# 1. Read legacy file to understand structure and content
# 2. Extract main content (excluding header/footer/navigation)
# 3. Convert to SPA format with proper breadcrumbs
# 4. Update all internal links to use showPage() navigation
# 5. Add page to titles object
# 6. Test navigation thoroughly
# 7. Delete legacy file only after successful migration
```

### 3. Testing Navigation Completeness
```bash
# Check all showPage references (what's being called)
grep -o "showPage('[^']*')" index-spa.html | sort | uniq

# Check existing page definitions (what exists)
grep -o "id=\"[^\"]*\" class=\"page\"" index-spa.html | sed 's/id="//;s/" class="page"//'

# Find missing pages - any references without definitions
comm -23 <(grep -o "showPage('[^']*')" index-spa.html | sed "s/showPage('//;s/')//" | sort | uniq) <(grep -o 'id="[^"]*" class="page"' index-spa.html | sed 's/id="//;s/" class="page"//' | sort)

# Check for dead links (should return empty if all good)
# Above command shows pages that are referenced but don't exist
```

### 4. Form Development Standards
- Use standardized form classes matching ofcat patterns
- Include proper validation and accessibility attributes  
- Add JavaScript handlers for client-side processing
- Display success/error messages with proper styling
- Ensure forms work without page reloads (SPA-compatible)

## Key Principles

### SPA Benefits
- **No code duplication** - Single header, footer, navigation
- **Instant navigation** - No page reloads, immediate response
- **Easier maintenance** - One file to update, not 16+
- **Consistent styling** - Guaranteed consistency across all pages
- **Better performance** - Loads once, navigates instantly

### Content Quality
- All content should be realistic and useful
- Follow actual government website content patterns
- Include forms, processes, and practical information
- Add contact details, opening hours, and service descriptions

### Technical Standards
- Maintain exact GOV.UK styling and responsive design
- Use semantic HTML and proper accessibility features
- Follow ofcat form patterns and CSS classes
- Ensure all navigation links work correctly in SPA

### SPA Completeness
- Every showPage() call should have corresponding page section
- Related pages should cross-reference each other appropriately
- Footer links should all be functional within SPA
- Service pages should include complete workflows with working forms

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Check navigation completeness
grep -o "showPage('[^']*')" index-spa.html | sort | uniq

# Check existing pages
grep -o "id=\"[^\"]*\" class=\"page\"" index-spa.html

# Test form classes
grep -c "form-group\|form-label\|form-input" index-spa.html

# Verify netlify.toml SPA redirect
grep -A 5 "Redirect to SPA" netlify.toml
```
