## 📋 Action Plan to Fix Site Structure

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Navigation (URGENT)
1. **Link orphaned main pages** to homepage navigation
2. **Create missing department pages** (finance, commerce, culture, environment)
3. **Create emergency page** (prominently featured on homepage)
4. **Fix broken header navigation links**

### Phase 2: Consolidate Footer Links
1. **Audit footer destinations** - determine which to create vs remove
2. **Create landing pages** for major topics (benefits, business, education)
3. **Remove broken footer links** that aren't essential
4. **Group related services** under logical categories

### Phase 3: Improve Internal Linking
1. **Add cross-references** between related services
2. **Create "See also" sections** on each page
3. **Add breadcrumb navigation** throughout site
4. **Link department pages** to their relevant services
